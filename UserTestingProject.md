## person 1
note that this person viewed it on the phone so it was small

### Can you tell me what you think this is?

This is a poster about signing a petition to raise minimum wage in corporates to help workers keep up with their bills and make a better living situation

### Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
This is telling me that amazon workers cannot keep up with their bills given their current minimum wage and hours. And that  corporates need to be ethical about their environmental impact

### Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
What i find confusing is the 'what about the environment?' Part. I dont think this information is relevant at all to the petition. And the order of the information is also confusing first it talks about minimum wage then the environment then signing a petition for minumum wage workers. It's also unclear what the petition is for i only found out looking at the links it should be clearer. 

### Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
The intended audience are minmimum wage workers

### Is there anything you would change or do differently?
I would completely exclude the environmental aspect of the poster

### Do you have any other comment?
The quality of the poster is bad i cannot see small words in the graphs. And figures.

## person 3
This person viewed it on laptop. 
### Can you tell me what you think this is?

This is a poster about Amazon and its bad ethics

### Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
Amazon is not ethical. It does not pay its employees enough and amazon can offset emissions by planting trees. 

### Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
What I find surprising is that the graph is talking about two issues. I do not think it makes sense for them to be together. Also one story is told better than the other. Also the tree icon makes no sense. What does it even say? 

### Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
People interested in Amazon's ethics

### Is there anything you would change or do differently?
Color mismatch. It just looks weak, it is not a powerful visualization. The message deserves better than this. 

### Do you have any other comment?
No


## person 4
This person viewed it on laptop. 
### Can you tell me what you think this is?

This is an advertising or presentation for a petition

### Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
It is telling me that Amazon is not fair towards its workers, and not taking environmental responsibility as well.

### Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
I think The environment bar is caught between two visuals talking about wage, so I am confused with the logic there

### Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Someone interested in social questions? Especially Labor Economics related issues? Or someone who really hates big companies.

### Is there anything you would change or do differently?
I would try to do a comparison with some other companies or a baseline company to show that Amazon is doing really bad at its social responsibilities.

### Do you have any other comment?
The general storyline still feels a little unclear. If there will be more elements added into this presentation, maybe consider try to figure out a clearer logic line for the presentation.
Also, the cost of living plot shows the breakdown of living cost. Although I feel like the presentation doesn't really need the breakdown details.
