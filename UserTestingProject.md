## person 1

### Can you tell me what you think this is?

This is a poster about signing a petition to raise minimum wage in corporates to help workers keep up with their bills and make a better living situation

### Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
This is telling me that amazon workers cannot keep up with their bills given their current minimum wage and hours. And that  corporates need to be ethical about their environmental impact

### Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
What i find confusing is the 'what about the environment?' Part. I dont think this information is relevant at all to the petition. And the order of the information is also confusing first it talks about minimum wage then the environment then signing a petition for minumum wage workers. It's also unclear what the petition is for i only found out looking at the links it should be clearer. 

### Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
The intended audience are minmimum wage workers

### Is there anything you would change or do differently?
I would completely exclude the environmental aspect of the poster

### Do you have any other comment?
The quality of the poster is bad i cannot see small words in the graphs. And figures.
