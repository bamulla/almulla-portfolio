# About Me
My name is Buthayna AlMulla (she/her) and I am a MISM student enrolled in the Telling Stories with Data course. I like to fit design courses in my schedule as much as I can because I think they are very important. Learning the technical aspects of Information Systems can be useful only when paired with good design skills. At the end of the day, a program is as good as its design no matter how much work is put in the back end. This is because users would not be drawn to use a poorly designed program. Before taking any design courses I used to think that a good design comes only with practise and good taste, I expected the class to be practise only with no theory. After my first design course I was facisnated by the design theories, rules, and guidelines that helped improve my designs immensely. I look forward to take telling stories with data because I have learned how to analyse data in previous courses but the representation bit was always done using an automated graphing tool which is not user friendly especially not to an audience that is not familiar with data analytics. 

# What I Hope to Learn
- I hope to learn the science behind good data visualization rather than just going with my gut and what I think looks good. I would like to be able to go over my bias and give reasoning behind the design choices I make in order to ensure that they are good. 

- I hope to learn to make data visualizations that add meaning and narritive that are not just an accessory that I felt I needed to add. 

- I hope to learn to give good feedback to others when they ask for feedback for the visuals that they made. I would like to learn to give feedback that is meaningful and justifiable by means other than what my brain thinks looks good.
