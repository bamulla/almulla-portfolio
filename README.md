# About Me
My name is Buthayna AlMulla and I am a MISM student enrolled in the Telling Stories with Data course

# What I Hope to Learn
I hope to learn the science behind good visual designs rather than just going with my gut and what I think looks good. I would like to be able to go over my bias and give reasoning behind the design choices I make in order to ensure that they are good. 
I hope to learn to make visual designs that add meaning and narritive rather than be an accessory that I felt I needed to add. 
I hope to learn to give good feedback to group memebers when they ask for it for the designs that I made. I would like to learn to give feedback that is meaningful and backed up by a book rather than only speaking my mind.
