# User Testing

## person 1:
### - Can you tell me what you think this is?
This shows the percentage of people who are willing to take the vaccine relative to those who are not. The major reasons for those who arent are shown in graph 2

### - Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
Graph one is telling me that while the majority of people are willing to take the vaccine, the percentage is still not enough to achieve herd immunity which falls within the range of about 70 to 80%

Graph 2 is telling me that the reason the minority of people who wont take the test is mainly because of its potential side effects, the availibility, distribution logistics, cost and limited transparency. There are more reasons but the listed ones are the most common.

### - Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
I find it surprising that people are not willing to take the vaccine due to its cost because the cost of living during lockdown is far greater. It would save them money if they invest in the vaccine probably.
I also find it confusing how at 100% Buthayna wrote low level of vaccine support and at 0 she wrote high level of vaccine support

### - Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
The intended audience for this could be the health ministery officials that need to see this to come up with solutions to acheive herd immunity

### - Is there anything you would change or do differently?
I would specify the number for herd immunity. I would also add a grid. And change the colors of the bars to improve visuals. 

The End

## person 2:
### - Can you tell me what you think this is?
Looks like a graph about the vaccine support and concerns about the vaccine


### - Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
Not enough people are willing to take the vaccine in order to achieve herd immunity. Also it lists the concerns but I am unsure what the bar represents. 

### - Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

The labels of the bargraph in graph 1 are very confusing. What does Vaccine hesitant mean? Also, in graph 2, What does concerns of 78% of the people mean? Why is it in the graph? 

### - Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

Anyone who is interested

### - Is there anything you would change or do differently?
Add more lables to the axis. It can be confusing and requires a lot of gussing on my part. Also elaborate on what concerns of 78% of people means. 

The End
