## Summary

### The Intended Audience
This is intended to persuade people that minimum wage is not ethical as people cannot live off it, and that corporations can afford to pay their workers well and they have no reason not to. 

While this can be used to persuade different types of people, the specific target audience would be young people who love to advocate for change. 

Given that my audience is young people, I made sure to minimize the text, and ensure that my story can be told using the visualizations. I also provided a link in the top right for these people to share this link in twitter. I also put up a list with all the petitions they can sign to save time. 

Furthermore, I wanted the audience to be able to empathize with the struggles of minimum wage workers regardless of their financial state. So I created a visualization that can show people who have never had money problems how difficult it is to live off a minimum wage. I wanted the users to visually try to fit all the expenses within the box that represents the annual salary on minimum wage. I wanted the audience to have to pick and prioratise between different things in order to fit the box. What I hoped to achieve with that visual is empathy, as this difficult position of having to pick between food and rent is something not everyone has expereinced and can empathize with. 

### Information and Data
As my story progressed, I have looked elsewhere for data that better told the story. The first new find is [livingwage website] (https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/06071)which had exact data I needed as my story evolved and became more specific. This is because the story moved from being specifically about workers have a living wage, and moved away from Amazon's sustainability. 

Also, I calculated some data manually. For example, I calculated the average from the living wages and found that it was $32. I then subtracted $15 from it to find that amazon needed to pay these workers on average $17 and hour more than what they are currenlty paying them. To find out the year extra cost that would be I found out how many minimum wage workers are in Amazon from [Wired.](https://www.wired.com/story/why-amazon-really-raised-minimum-wage/) From there I found out that amazon's minimum wage workers consisted of 250,000 full time and 100000 seasonal workers. I then did the math:

17*262*8= 35,632*250,000=8,908,000,000 For full-time workers 

17*131*8=17,816*100,000=1,781,600,000 For seasonal workers

Total=10,689,600,000

The data on amazon's revenue is something I had from the start, I got it from [statistica](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273963/quarterly-revenue-of-amazoncom/)

The images used is from pexels, both images were free to use with no attribution required. I still attributed the images at the bottom left. 

### Overall Strategy Towards The Final Design
The main feedback I recieved was that my story was confusing, and too broad, and not well presented. The first thing I did was narrow it down by making it focused on the living wage. This helped solved the other problems. This time, to save time, I did mini feedback sessions from friends and family throughout the design process. This is to ensure that I am on the right track. I did my best to make my story more clear and focused and I am pretty happy with how that turned out. 

### Tools used
Shorthand and Flourish were new tools, and it took a huge learning curve for me to be able to communicate through them. I actually have tried to use shorthand before but got frustrated and used another tool. This time I figured it out as I finally found how to integrate html, CSS, and javascript within shorthand. I was so excited because this gave me the opportunity to go beyond what Flourish can offer. I wanted to create a visualization that put the viewer in the shoe of a household whose moneymaker was a minimum wage worker. So I created a box with each 1 pixel width representing $100 that they make within the year. I also created draggable boxes for each expense category. For each box 1 pixel in width represented $100 in cost. This way, the sizes were relative to the data which I took from the first visualization and data source. 

In order to make the coded part of the visualization, I started with base code I found online from this page on [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_draggable.asp) for the dragable boxes. For the fixed box I used base code from this page also on [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_rect.asp) as well. I changed the code to fit my specific needs.
