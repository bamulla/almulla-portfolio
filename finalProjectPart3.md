# Final Project Part 3


## Summary

### The Intended Audience
This is intended to persuade people that minimum wage is not ethical as people cannot live off it, and that corporations can afford to pay their workers well and they have no reason not to. 

While this can be used to persuade different types of people, the specific target audience would be people who love to advocate for change. 

### Information and Data
As my story progressed, I have looked elsewhere for data that better told the story. The first new find is [livingwage website] (https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/06071)which had exact data I needed as my story evolved and became more specific. This is because the story moved from being specifically about workers have a living wage, and moved away from Amazon's sustainability. 

Also, I calculated some data manually. For example, I calculated the average from the living wages and found that it was $32. I then subtracted $15 from it to find that amazon needed to pay these workers on average $17 and hour more than what they are currenlty paying them. To find out the year extra cost that would be I found out how many minimum wage workers are in Amazon from [Wired.](https://www.wired.com/story/why-amazon-really-raised-minimum-wage/) From there I found out that amazon's minimum wage workers consisted of 250,000 full time and 100000 seasonal workers. I then did the math:

17*262*8= 35,632*250,000=8,908,000,000 For full-time workers 

17*131*8=17,816*100,000=1,781,600,000 For seasonal workers

Total=10,689,600,000
