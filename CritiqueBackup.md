## Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here. What stood out to you? What did you find worked really well? What didn't? What, if anything, would you do differently?  *

What stood out to me in the visualization is the strong message. I saw a lot of important purpose in the data. The data is very useful. I also enjoyed the color scheme which I thought looked nice. However, something about the graph that restricted its usefulness was how busy it was. 

The first thing I noticed when I looked at the visualization was the large amount of data that it included. The visualization was telling a lot of stories at once which was very confusing for the viewer. I liked that they had the purpose of the visualization in it, however I do not like how it was hidden by a lot of text. The title is not very informative on the purpose of the graph which I believe is to show that the people who are willing to take the vaccine are not enough to achieve herd immunity. I wish that was the title instead. While the color scheme is good, there are a lot of elements to the graph it is difficult to use color to bring attention to a variable. 

I do not like the pie chart in the middle. The earth image in the middle is unnecessary and distracting. The pie chart seems to be telling stories which should be told by multiple visualizations. The pointers around the center of the pie chart are very confusing. The amount of color would be fine had this pie chart been split to an appropriate number of visualizations. However, since they are all in one the amount of the color around the center is very overwhelming. 

The eye travel distance is very large in this graph which is concerning. At first sight, I could not seem to fixate my eyes on one aspect as the visualization contained a lot of components with no hierarchy. I found myself going back and forth between components without giving myself enough time to study each component and understand it. All the sections are competing with each other for attention. It is very distracting and so more time will be needed to comprehend the visualization. 

What I would do differently is first limit the number of stories told by two. Two separate visualizations would be enough to show the purpose of the graph which I assume is firstly to show that the proportion of people willing to get vaccinated is not enough to achieve herd immunity, and secondly to give data on the most prominent concerns about the virus so that they can be addressed.  

What I would do is show the proportion of people with different levels of support. This visualization would show that only 66% of people are willing to get vaccinated which is less than the requirement of 70% or 80% to achieve herd immunity. For the second visualization, I will list the concerns and the percentage of people concerned about each. The second visualization will aim to show data on them in order to inform people in decision making on the most prominent concerns so that addressing them would be prioritized, and more people would be convinced to get vaccinated.  

## Who is the primary audience for this tool? Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience? Why or why not? *

I think that the primary audience for this tool is decision makers in government sector who are monitoring the health and safety during the pandemic, I think it is trying to show them that not enough people buy into the virus in order to achieve herd immunity, and who to target to convince to get the vaccine. 

I do not think this visualization is effective because people in powerful positions are very busy, and because the visualization cannot be quickly scanned and understood, the viewer will give up on it before gaining any insight. When dealing with a busy audience, one must ensure the visualization is clear and can be quickly scanned. 

## Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here? What would you change? Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.) *

I think this method was successful in evaluating the data visualization. I was able to brainstorm a lot of ideas which were inspired by the metrics. However, I think that the metrics are a little bit generic. I would love to add some specific metrics that are important. For example, it would be helpful to add the following metrics: 

1) I would want to rate the simplicity of the graph. I would want to rate how clear and simple the graph is. A nice simple graph would not contain any unnecessary elements. Every element serves a purpose in a clear simple graph. 

2) I would rate how clear the purpose of the graph is and whether a purpose is laid out or not. It is very easy to find purposeless visualizations that are made for the sake of decoration. Adding this metric is important because a good visualization always has a clear purpose.
