This is the visualization to be critiqued.

I selected this visualization because I thought it had a lot of important messages that were burried in this graph. An influx of important messages would give no message a priority. Which is why I thought it would be interesting to redesign this visualization, and pick one important message and display it in a simple way to give it importance. 

The next step was to critique the visualization. This step was submitted in the survey. A backup of the questions can be found in the following page.

## Testing the solution
person 1:
- Can you tell me what you think this is?
This shows the percentage of people who are willing to take the vaccine relative to those who are not. The major reasons for those who arent are shown in graph 2

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
Graph one is telling me that while the majority of people are willing to take the vaccine, the percentage is still not enough to achieve herd immunity which falls within the range of about 70 to 80%

Graph 2 is telling me that the reason the minority of people who wont take the test is mainly because of its potential side effects, the availibility, distribution logistics, cost and limited transparency. There are more reasons but the listed ones are the most common.

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
I find it surprising that people are not willing to take the vaccine due to its cost because the cost of living during lockdown is far greater. It would save them money if they invest in the vaccine probably.
I also find it confusing how at 100% Buthayna wrote low level of vaccine support and at 0 she wrote high level of vaccine support

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
The intended audience for this could be the health ministery officials that need to see this to come up with solutions to acheive herd immunity

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
I would specify the number for herd immunity. I would also add a grid. And change the colors of the bars to improve visuals. 

The End

Notes from interview: When I put 100 I meant percentages. I was unaware that other people might think that this refers to the level of support. To solve this issue I will label the percentage better. Also, I will put up a legend for the level of support and use colors to signify the amount of support. 
I found it weird that this viewer, when looking at graph 2 notes the bottom concerns not the top. I wanted to highlight the top 4, so I will make sure they are better highlighted. 

person 2:
- Can you tell me what you think this is?
Looks like a graph about the vaccine support and concerns about the vaccine


- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
Not enough people are willing to take the vaccine in order to achieve herd immunity. Also it lists the concerns but I am unsure what the bar represents. 

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

The labels of the bargraph in graph 1 are very confusing. What does Vaccine hesitant mean? Also, in graph 2, What does concerns of 78% of the people mean? Why is it in the graph? 

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

Anyone who is interested

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
Add more lables to the axis. It can be confusing and requires a lot of gussing on my part. Also elaborate on what concerns of 78% of people means. 

The End

Noted from interview: I just realized that the naming of each level of support is confusing. I took the names from the source which was much more informative. Now that I simplified it, the naming is weird. I will edit the name of each level of support. I will make sure I label correctly. Also, I will edit the part that highlights the concers of 78% of people. I meant to highlight all the concerns from the 78% people with higher support. This is so the decision maker can prioratise them in order to achieve herd immunity. I will try to make sure that this is clear. 

## The Process

### WireFraming
After picking the visualization, I started the critique. The critique process helped flesh out the problems of the visualization. The biggest issue in this visualization is how complex, busy, and cluttered it is. At the begining of the critique, I was unsure about the purpose of the visualization. The more I assessed it, the more small stories I was able to extract from the data. I picked the first two aparent stories that I was able to extract to focus the redesign on. 

I deduced that the most important purpose of the visualization is to relay the message that the percentage of people willing to get vaccinated is below the percentage necessary to gain herd immunity. This information alone is useless, and I thought it must be followed by data that would help guide the discussion to solve this problem. For the next visualization, I decided to list the concerns people gave alongside the percentage of people who had those concerns. In the second visualization I also wanted to highlight all the concerns for vaccine supporters and vaccine hesitants. This is because these two groups together make 78% of the population. Therfore, if the concerns were all addressed in order of priority, then more people are likely to be convinced to take the vaccine. The wireframes were created based on this idea.

I then did some user testing on my sisters. I gained some important insight that gave me ideas on how to further improve the visualizations. This also made me aware of some vagueness in my visualizations. I realized that in the journey to simplify the original visualization, I ended up oversimplifying the visualizations. The main analysis from user testing can be found in the user testing section. 

These are the redesigned visualizations.

The main aspect I worked on is simplifying the visualization. I thought the orignal was very busy and told so many stories at once, which made it very hard to distinguish the purpose of the graph. I picked one story that I found and used the data to create two simple visualization that can tell it more clearly. 

The purpose of the graph is to
