## Critique
### Critique was submitted in the form of a survey, here is a portion of the critique

What stood out to me was the amount of data in the visualization. I saw that the graph was telling a lot of stories at once that it was getting confusing. I liked that they had the purpose of the visualization in it, however I do not like how it hidden by a lot of text. The title is not very informative on the purpose of the graph which I believe is to show that the people who are willing to take the vaccine are not enough to achieve herd immunity. I wish that was the title instead. The color choice is good, however since there are a lot of elements to the graph it is difficult to use color to bring attention to a variable. At first sight, I was able to diagnose this visualization with a bad case of overly complicated. Sometimes, using basic visualizations can serve a better purpose. 

I do not like the pie chart in the middle. The earth image in the middle is unnecessary and distracting. The pie chart seems to be telling stories which should be told by multiple visualizations. The pointers around the center of the pie chart are very confusing. The amount of color would be fine had this pie chart been split to an appropriate number of visualizations. However, since they are all in one the amount of the color around the center is very overwhelming. 

The eye travel distance is very large in this graph which is concerning. At first sight, I could not seem to fixate my eyes on one aspect as the visualization contained a lot of components with no hierarchy. I found myself going back and forth between components without giving myself enough time to study each component and understand it. All the sections are competing with each other for attention. It is very distracting and so more time will be needed to comprehend the visualization. 

What I would do differently is first limit the number of stories told by two. Two separate visualizations would be enough to show the purpose of the graph which I assume is firstly to show that the proportion of people willing to get vaccinated is not enough to achieve herd immunity, and secondly to give data on the most prominent concerns about the virus so that they can be addressed.  

What I would do is show the proportion of people with different levels of support. This visualization would show that only 66% of people are willing to get vaccinated which is less than the requirement of 70% or 80% to achieve herd immunity. For the second visualization, I will list the concerns and the percentage of people concerned about each. The second visualization will aim to show data on them in order to inform people in decision making on the most prominent concerns so that addressing them would be prioritized, and more people would be convinced to get vaccinated.
