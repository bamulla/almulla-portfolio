## Compare and Contrast

The first visualization is too focused on one aspect of the data. It does not tell that much of a story. The second graph has a lot of information. It tells a lot of stories. It is also very busy and the viwer does not know where to look at. Furthermore, a viewer cannot gain insight from an individual graph as it is too small. The third graph shows specific data about each year which is what can be achieved in graph 1, but it can also show every year which is what graph 2 achieves. Furthermore, if the viewer slides the year slider, they can see how the ratio changes yearly. Then it can be very evident that there are two countries racing to get a higher dept-to-GDP ratio; Japan and Greece.

Having said that, I still find some problems with the third chart that I have not been able to figure out how to fix using flourish. For example, I wanted to give the two highlighted countries a contrasting color.
