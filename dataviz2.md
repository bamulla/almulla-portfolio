## Compare and Contrast

The bar graph is too focused on one aspect of the data. It does not tell that much of a story it just shows the data. The first graph simplifies the data as it does not show how the debt evolves yearly. The second graph has a lot of data. It is very busy and the viewer does not know where to look at. Very difficult to know the purpose of the graph when there are a lot of aspects. Furthermore, a viewer cannot gain insight from an individual graph in the grid as individual graphs are too small. Both of these graphs do not have a story to tell. 

The scatter graph shows specific data about each year which is what can be achieved in the bar graph, but it can also show every year which is what grid of line charts achieves. Furthermore, if the viewer slides the year slider, they can see how the ratio changes yearly. Then it can be very evident that there are two countries racing to get a higher dept-to-GDP ratio; Japan and Greece. They both have a high increase in debt but this implies different things in each country. While high debt is bad, Greece's debt leaves it worse off than Japan even though Japan's debt is higher. This is because Greece owes foreign creditors while Japans owes its citizens. Since these two countries are what the story focuses on, they were both given contrasting colors while other countries are greyed down. Greece was given orange as it is in a more danger zone than Japan which was given green. The contrasting colors save time as the user can find the countries in question faster. Furthermore, there is a lable of the ratio and country name which comes up when the mouse goes over the dot to eliminate unnecessary eye travel. Most importantly, the scatter graph tells a story.
